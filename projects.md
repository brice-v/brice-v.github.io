### Safer Stoves

In my sophmore year of school, a group project tasked the students with building a device that would benefit the safety of an eldery population.

My group and I decided to make a device that would take the worry out of potentially having a kitchen fire. And so Safer Stoves was born!
This little device was made using an Arduino, as the brains, and a motion sensor combined with a gas valve / relay for the sensors.

The device had a display that could set the timer to the length of the cooking, and if the user was innatentive to their food, it would shut off the stove.

Safer Stoves made it to the top 10 of all the sophmore engineers!

### Design, Simulation, Implementation of an 8-Band Equalizer

Junior year in my Electronics Class, the students were all tasked of creating an equalizer of at least 4-bands that would span the human hearing frequency range (20Hz to 20kHz).  

My partner and I decided to design an 8-band equalizer using second order bandpass filters.  This meant that overall their would be less components per band and it would allow for easier implementation. (As well as being cheaper!)

The equalizer was designed using OrCAD PSpice and simulated using Allegro  Simulator.  Everything was made sure to be working properly and then all components were assembled onto a breadboard!

### Simulation and Implementation of Audio Power Amplifier

Sophmore year in my Electronic Circuit Analysis class, we were told to simulate and construct a given audio power amplifier circuit.  

The design was constructed within OrCAD PSpice and simulated using Allegro Simulator. We were all asked to find the crucial values that distinguish a good Audio Power Amplifier from a bad one such as it's frequency response, the distortion at different levels, and the power gain.

Then the circuit was constructed on a breadboard and tested thoroughly to ensure that it was working and amplifying the signal.  We learned alot about how to handle heat that day!
