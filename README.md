### Safer Stoves


In my sophmore year of school, a group project tasked the students with building a device that would benefit the safety of an eldery population.

My group and I decided to make a device that would take the worry out of potentially having a kitchen fire. And so Safer Stoves was born!
This little device was made using an Arduino, as the brains, and a motion sensor combined with a gas valve / relay for the sensors.

The device had a display that could set the timer to the length of the cooking, and if the user was innatentive to their food, it would shut off the stove.

Safer Stoves made it to the top 10 of all the sophmore engineers!
