## Things I Like

Music is my first and foremost passion.  I play guitar and listen to music every day.  Sometimes I even play live with my friends. I've played the trumpet for 12 years but had to play a little less ever since being in a dorm.

I love to tinker and play with computers, especially single board computers. Recently i've gotten a Raspberry Pi and the possibilites of things that can be done with it are endless.  In addition to that though I've built a plethora of computers and I like to be up to date with the next best thing.  I really like linux and open source software.  My personal favorite distro is Ubuntu for the ease of use.

I'm very interested in microprocessor architecture and decided for my capstone that I would build my own.  I hope to learn alot about the core foundations to processor design.  Heres a [link to a instruction set simulator](https://brice-v.github.io/projects#instruction-set-simulator) I built for it!

I also like to code! Python has by far become my favorite language becuase of its versatility but I've also coded in Java, Matlab, C++, SQL, and Adobe Coldfusion.

Then of course is watching videos, reading books, and playing video games.
