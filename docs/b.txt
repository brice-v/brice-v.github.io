### Other notes

    - No semicolons needed
    - Builtin doc generator
    - builtin package manager (done the same way as something like rust with semver)
    - good size std lib like the python one (possibly with gui - maybe something simple or use like fyne)
    - can run funtions at top level
    - scripting should be easy and intuitive
    - just going to use channels and go routines
    - have a set of good math/crypto by using go's
        - as well as all the other good parts
        - archiving/compression
        - sqlite builtin or maybe some other db
        - dealing with csv builtin
        - io, files, sockets, etc...
        - os layer thats similar to posix and shell scripting
        - good datetime layer like pythons
        - argparser, flagparser, interacting with env vars
    - have a good set of collections # b trees, rb trees, queues etc...
    - `in` keyword like python allows iteration over a list/slice/range/etc...
    - maybe include some go libs to provide extra cool functionality
    - test blocks for easy testing in a file or as a seperate file
    - Importing is like it is in go but NOTE: need to fix the gopath stuff to make it trivial
        - Or im gonna make it like it is in zig/js const myns = import("path/here")
        -                                         maybe const _ = import("path") will make the names top level
        -                                 or somethign like const __main__ = ... because thats like the top level 
    - maybe make regex top level like it is in ruby/js `/[0-9]abc\w+/`
    - raw strings like in go with ` backtick
    - using go gc and their scheduler
    - will need some formatter builtin (like gofmt or black)
    - string interpolation in any string
    - some sort of debugger builtin possibly
    - maybe have shortcut in order to execute shell commands (but still in go)
    - maybe console ui package
    - builtin generics probably - this will just generate code for every type but if it can determine at compile time who calls then it can just generate the necessary
    - json decoding and other configuration parsing stuff
    - all str stuff would act like pythons
    - requests like pacakge builtin that allows you to download something easy ( this would be apart of the package manager)
